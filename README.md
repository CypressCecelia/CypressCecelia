### Hi new friend! 👋

I'm Cecelia, a Success Engineer at Cypress in Atlanta, GA. You can read about why I joined Cypress and my volunteer work for underrepresented groups in tech in this blog post.

If you have any questions about projects, please open an issue on the repository! This will 
1) make sure I can't forget to reply 😅
2) give you credit toward contributions on GitHub 💚

I also tweet about tech and being a human [@ceceliacreates](http://www.twitter.com/ceceliacreates) 🐦

Cheers!
